# Learning new features

Pandemonium is a feature-rich game engine. There is a lot to learn about it. This page
explains how you can use the online manual, built-in code reference, and join
online communities to learn new features and techniques.

## Learning to think like a programmer

Teaching programming foundations and how to think like a game developer is
beyond the scope of Pandemonium's documentation. If you're new to programming, we
recommend two excellent free resources to get you started:

1. Harvard university offers a free courseware to learn to program,
   [CS50]( https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). It will teach you programming
   fundamentals, how code works, and how to think like a programmer. These
   skills are essential to become a game developer and learn any game engine
   efficiently. You can see this course as an investment that will save you time
   and trouble when you learn to create games.

2. If you prefer books, check out the free ebook
   [Automate The Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
   by Al Sweigart.
