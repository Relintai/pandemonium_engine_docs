# Your first 2D game

In this step-by-step tutorial series, you will create your first complete 2D
game with Pandemonium. By the end of the series, you will have a simple yet complete
game of your own, like the image below.

You will learn how the Pandemonium editor works, how to structure a project, and build
a 2D game.

Note: This project is an introduction to the Pandemonium engine. It assumes that
you have some programming experience already. If you're new to
programming entirely, you should start [here](../../03_usage/15_scripting/).

The game is called "Dodge the Creeps!". Your character must move and avoid the
enemies for as long as possible.

You will learn to:

- Create a complete 2D game with the Pandemonium editor.
- Structure a simple game project.
- Move the player character and change its sprite.
- Spawn random enemies.
- Count the score.

And more.

You'll find another series where you'll create a similar game but in 3D. We
recommend you to start with this one, though.

**Why start with 2D?**

3D games are much more complex than 2D ones. It would be best if you stuck to 2D
until you understood the game development process and how to use Pandemonium well.

You can find a completed version of this project [here](../../07_demo_projects/2d/dodge_the_creeps/).

## Prerequisites

We prepared some game assets you'll need to download so we can jump straight to
the code.
