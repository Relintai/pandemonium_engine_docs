You can pat yourself on the back for having completed your first 3D game with
Pandemonium.

In this series, we went over a wide range of techniques and editor features.
Hopefully, you’ve witnessed how intuitive Pandemonium’s scene system can be and

time creating games. And you can learn all that by browsing the documentation.
