# Mesh

## Modifiers

There is an exporting option `Apply Modifiers` to
control whether mesh modifiers are applied to the exported mesh.

## Shape Key

Exporting mesh shape key is supported, however exporting each shape key
is almost like exporting the mesh again, so don't be surprised
it takes a relatively long time.

Warning: A lot of modifiers are not compatible with shape keys
(e.g. subsurface modifier), so if you found you have
incorrect shape keys exported, try to disable `Apply Modifiers`
and do the exporting again.
