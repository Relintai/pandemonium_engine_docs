# Contributing

Everyone is most welcome to contribute to Pandemonium. Here are some ways in which you
can contribute to the project:

- Improving the engine by fixing bugs, coding new features, or refining existing ones.
- Writing or proofreading documentation. You can contribute both to this
  reference manual or the code reference.
- Translating the editor or documentation from English to other languages.

## Getting started

You would like to contribute but you don't know how or what to do? You can get
answers below.

## Contributing to the engine

The guides below explain how to contribute to the engine's core. You will learn
about the code style, the contribution workflow, and more.

## Writing documentation

We always need help to improve the documentation, be it the class reference or
the manual. Below, you can find our content and writing guidelines and
concrete guides to make changes to the documentation.

### Guidelines

Here are the principles and guidelines we strive to follow to write accessible
documentation.

### Writing the manual

### Class reference guides

The pages below focus on the class reference.

As the reference is included in the Pandemonium editor, its source files are part of
the [pandemonium repository](https://github.com/Relintai/pandemonium_engine). We use XML files
to write it, so the process to contribute to the class reference differs from
writing the online manual.

### Translating the documentation

The community is always working hard on making Pandemonium and its documentation
available to more people. Localizing the documentation is a colossal and ongoing
effort you can be part of.
