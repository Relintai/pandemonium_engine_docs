Pandemonium Docs â€“ *3.5* branch
=========================

.. only:: not i18n

  Note:
 Pandemonium's documentation is available in various languages and versions.
            Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see
            the list.

  Tip:
 This is the documentation for the 3.5 branch.
           Looking for the documentation of the current **development** branch?
           `Have a look here ( https://docs.pandemoniumengine.org/en/latest )`.
           You can also browse the documentation for the current stable
           `3.4 ( https://docs.pandemoniumengine.org/en/3.4 )` branch.

.. only:: i18n

  Note:
 This documentation is translated from the `original English one
            ( https://docs.pandemoniumengine.org/en/latest )` by community members
            on `Weblate ( https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/pandemonium-engine/pandemonium-docs )`.

            Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may
            find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can
            help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing
            ones on Weblate.

            For the time being, localized translations are only available for
            the "latest" (development) branch, but should be suitable to learn
            how to use stable Pandemonium releases nevertheless.

Welcome to the official documentation of `Pandemonium Engine ( https://pandemoniumengine.org )`,
the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! If you are new
to this documentation, we recommend that you read the
`introduction page ( doc_about_intro )` to get an overview of what this
documentation has to offer.

The table of contents below and in the sidebar should let you easily access the

Note:
 Pandemonium Engine is an open source project developed by a community of
          volunteers. The documentation team can always use your
