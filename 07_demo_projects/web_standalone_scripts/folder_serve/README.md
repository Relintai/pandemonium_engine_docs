# Folder Serve Demo

This is a small script that serves a folder (and it's subfolders) as a static site.

Similar to `python -m http.server`

It's derived from the SceneTree, so you don't need to run this as a project, 
instead you need to get the engine, and run it with the `-s` (`--script`) option like so:

`./pandemonium -s ./folder_serve.gd .`
