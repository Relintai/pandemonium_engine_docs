# Pandemonium Engine documentation

This repository contains the source files of [Pandemonium Engine](https://pandemoniumengine.org)'s documentation, in the markdown markup language.

## Contributing changes

Pull Requests should use the `master` branch by default. Only make Pull Requests against other branches (e.g. `2.1` or `3.0`) if your changes only 
apply to that specific version of Pandemonium.

Though arguably less convenient to edit than a wiki, this Git repository is meant to receive pull requests to always improve the 
documentation, add new pages, etc. Having direct access to the source files in a revision control system is a 
big plus to ensure the quality of our documentation.
