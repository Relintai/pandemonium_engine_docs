AudioStreamMicrophone
=====================

**Inherits:** :ref:`AudioStream<class_AudioStream>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Plays real-time audio input data.

Description
-----------

When used directly in an :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer<class_AudioStreamPlayer>` node, ``AudioStreamMicrophone`` plays back microphone input in real-time. This can be used in conjunction with :ref:`AudioEffectCapture<class_AudioEffectCapture>` to process the data or save it.

\ **Note:** :ref:`ProjectSettings.audio/enable_audio_input<class_ProjectSettings_property_audio/enable_audio_input>` must be ``true`` for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
