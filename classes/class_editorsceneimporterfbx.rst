FBX 3D asset importer.

Description
-----------

This is an FBX 3D asset importer with full support for most FBX features.

If exporting a FBX scene from Autodesk Maya, use these FBX export settings:

::

    - Smoothing Groups
    - Smooth Mesh
    - Triangluate (for meshes with blend shapes)
    - Bake Animation
    - Resample All
    - Deformed Models
    - Skins
    - Blend Shapes
    - Curve Filters
    - Constant Key Reducer
    - Auto Tangents Only
    - *Do not check* Constraints (as it will break the file)
    - Can check Embed Media (embeds textures into the exported FBX file)
      - Note that when importing embedded media, the texture and mesh will be a single immutable file.
      - You will have to re-export then re-import the FBX if the texture has changed.
    - Units: Centimeters
    - Up Axis: Y
    - Binary format in FBX 2017
