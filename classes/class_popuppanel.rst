PopupPanel

**Inherits:** :ref:`Popup<class_Popup>` **<** :ref:`Control<class_Control>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_CanvasItem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Class for displaying popups with a panel background.

Description
-----------

Class for displaying popups with a panel background. In some cases it might be simpler to use than :ref:`Popup<class_Popup>`, since it provides a configurable background. If you are making windows, better check :ref:`WindowDialog<class_WindowDialog>`.

If any :ref:`Control<class_Control>` node is added as a child of this ``PopupPanel``, it will be stretched to fit the panel's size (similar to how :ref:`PanelContainer<class_PanelContainer>` works).
