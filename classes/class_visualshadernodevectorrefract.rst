VisualShaderNodeVectorRefract
=============================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Returns the :ref:`Vector3<class_Vector3>` that points in the direction of refraction. For use within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

Translated to ``refract(I, N, eta)`` in the shader language, where ``I`` is the incident vector, ``N`` is the normal vector and ``eta`` is the ratio of the indices of the refraction.
