Tutorials and resources
=======================

This is a list of third-party tutorials and resources created by the Pandemonium community. For resources, remember that there is the official `Pandemonium Asset Library ( https://pandemoniumengine.org/asset-library/asset )` full of official and community resources too! Also, have a look at this `huge list over at Reddit ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pandemonium/comments/an0iq5/pandemonium_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/ )`.

Think there is something missing here? Feel free to submit a `Pull Request ( https://github.com/Relintai/pandemonium_engine-docs/blob/master/community/tutorials.rst )` as always.

Where to start
--------------

The Pandemonium video tutorials by `GDQuest ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ/playlists )`, `Game from Scratch ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDEcP8Mc-7s&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyDk79j9ewONxV88fD5e_o5d )` and `KidsCanCode ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNaPQ5uLX5iIEHUCLmfAgKg/playlists )` are well-regarded in the community and often recommended as a gentle introduction to beginners.

If you're interested in Visual Scripting, `Emilio's tutorials ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9DR22-qohBDtZ74R3FxOZg )` may be worth a look.

If you're interested in a complete introduction to programming using Pandemonium and GDScript, the unofficial `Pandemonium Tutorials ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnr9ojBEQGgwbcKsZC-2rIg )` YouTube channel is a good place to start.

GDQuest's *Learn GDScript From Zero* is a free and open source interactive tutorial for absolute beginners to learn to program with Pandemonium's GDScript language. It is available as a `desktop application ( https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-pandemonium-gdscript )`  or `in the browser ( https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript )`.

Some tutorials mentioned below provide more advanced tutorials, e.g. on 3D or shaders.
