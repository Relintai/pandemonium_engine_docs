Configuring an IDE
==================

We assume that you have already `cloned ( https://github.com/Relintai/pandemonium_engine )`
and `compiled <toc-devel-compiling )` Pandemonium.

You can easily develop Pandemonium with any text editor and by invoking `scons`
on the command line, but if you want to work with an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment), here are setup instructions for some popular ones:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :name: toc-devel-configuring_an_ide

   android_studio
   clion
   code_blocks
   kdevelop
   qt_creator
   visual_studio
   visual_studio_code
   xcode

It is possible to use other IDEs, but their setup is not documented yet.
