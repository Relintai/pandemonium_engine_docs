# TileMap

Godot's TileMap but as an engine module, with a few smaller features added.

The tilemap classes will be prefixed with R, so it compiles cleanly with the built in TileMap class.

# Building

1. Get the source code for the engine.

```git clone -b 3.x https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git godot```

2. Go into Godot's modules directory.

```
cd ./godot/modules/
```

3. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Relintai/rtile_map.git rtile_map
```

4. Build Godot. [Tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/index.html)
