* It must work with the latest Godot version of the branch you're submitting to.

* It must follow all of the Godot style guides, including the GDScript
  style guide and the C# style guide.

* The demo should not be overcomplicated. Simplicity is usually preferred.

* If you are submitting a new demo, please ensure that it includes a
  README file similar to the other demos.

* If you are submitting a copy of a demo translated to C# etc:

    * Please ensure that there is a good reason to have this demo translated.
      We don't want to have multiple copies of every single project.

    * Please ensure that the code mirrors the original closely.

    * In the project.godot file and in the README, include "with C#" etc in
      the title, and also include a link to the original in the README.
