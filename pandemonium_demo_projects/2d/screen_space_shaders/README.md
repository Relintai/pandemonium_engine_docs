# Screen Space Shaders

Several examples of full screen 2D shader processing.
Many common full-res effects are implemented here for reference.

Language: [GDSL](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/shaders/shader_reference/shading_language.html) and GDScript

Renderer: GLES 3 (the blur effect is not available in GLES 2, the rest work)

Check out this demo on the asset library: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/122
