The textures are from the https://github.com/jarikomppa/proctree repository.

From the original readme:

All of the textures are CC0 / public domain material (primarily, if not completely, by nobiax.deviantart.com). The additional textures do let you make more varieties of trees though; the base package only comes with one trunk and twig texture.

Additional (not mandatory) 400 megs of trunk / twig textures

If you opt to download the additional textures, just unzip both zips in the same place. HappyTree will work without the additional textures (it'll actually be faster), so if you're just trying it out, I recommend NOT downloading the additional stuff.
